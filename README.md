#### Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
### The statistics of CoronaVirus globally can be found <a href="https://google.org/crisisresponse/covid19-map?hl=en">here</a>
### This project shows the affect of coronavirus worldwide.
### In this project the Dataset used for globally is COVID-19. Here there are so many visualization and comparision of effects of different countries.
### predicted the effect of Coronavirus using Time Series Forecasting.
### I will develop Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, models for the problem,and approach modeling by both manual and automatic configuration of the ARIMA model.
